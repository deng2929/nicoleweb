    <p>Here is what I like!</p>
    <style>
        p{text-align: center;}
    </style>

        <h2> Travel </h2>
        <p>
            I have traveled alot in the past, and you can see where on the next page, it is something that I truly enjoy. 
            Expercing new different environments gives me more knowledge.
            I do plan to travel more in the future, once I graduate!
        </p>
        <h2>Writing</h2>
        <p>
            In highschool, I was always in advanced English and writing class.
            I always had a knack for writing! It's theraputic and free flowing.
        </p>
        <h2>Sports</h2>
        <p>
            I dont play sports anymore but when I was younger I did cheer and tennis. 
            Currently, the gym has taken over my life. 
        </p>
        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>
            I feel like reading and writing goes hand in hand bringing me with a lot of intrest in reading!
            I enjoy a wide range of generes, so it wouldn't be fair to choose.
            Bell Hooks has me ties at the moment.
        </p>
        <h2>Creativity</h2>
        <p>
            When it comes to creativity, I have no limits. I enjoy making flyers and being able to do graphic design!
            I use to be a Youtuber, so editing is something I'm strong at. 
            I owned a business in the past and that required a lot of creation requirement.
        </p>
        <h2>Lifestyle</h2>
        <p>
            I mean lifestyle as in a few of my future goals. I enjoy self care and beauty, that led me to become a 
            lash tech and hopefully soon a esthetician! It allows me to combiine two passions I have had my whole life 
            beauty and healthcare.
